# Mint-Yz-theme branches: a short description

Please be aware that new branches are being created and old branches are being deleted as this repository evolves. So, this description here is quite possibly not up-to-date.

Branch name | Description
-------| -----------
**master** | (DEFAULT BRANCH) That is the big one. Where all the improvements from other branches are merged or will be merged.
source | (UPSTREAM) This one remains untouched. It is a copy of the upstream master source.
PR-newmain | Part of a GROUP of pull requests for the official Mint-Y. For a complete automation. This newmain has merged all the other parts of this group for demonstration purposes. Complete description: https://github.com/SebastJava/mint-yz-theme/tree/newmain#readme

buttonscolor | This is a reverting branch. Some kind of "undo". The new and official Mint-Y keeps the colors on the tiny little assets, but removes the colors on the buttons. This branch brings back the color on the active or "toggled" buttons.
newcolors | That is where the new colors are being selected and displayed.
smallsvg | src/Mint-Y/metacity-1/*.svg re-edited to make these files much smaller and faster (11 SVGs)
newflat | (OLD) This one is not new anymore. That's an old master branch.
OLD-auto | (OLD) Added and modified scripts for a complete automation. The `newcolors` branch was started from there. And then the `newflat` branch was started on top of all that.

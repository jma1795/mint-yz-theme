# Mint-Yz-theme branches: a short description

Branch | Description
-------| -----------
**newflat** | (DEFAULT BRANCH) That is the new big one. New colors for a new era. Colors to please everyone: mostly flat, subdued colors, plus some shining ones. Everything is included in this branch: complete automation from the `auto` branch, plus all the new colors, and more.
master | (UPSTREAM) This one remains untouched. So, if i want to create a pull request to the official Mint-Y, it must be for just one element, one bug fix or one new feature. So, i can start a new branch from this master one, and have only one new element on it, for one pull request.
